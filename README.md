# Hybrid Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Large-Scale Join Order Optimisation

This repository contains code and data artifacts for "Hybrid Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Large-Scale Join Order Optimisation", submitted to VLDB 2026.

## Project Structure

HybridMILPConvBenchmarks.py and HybridMILPScalabilityBenchmarks.py respectively apply our MILP method on queries contained in conventional query optimisation benchmarks (TPC-H [1], TPC-DS [2], LDBC [3], Join Order Benchmark [4]), as well as large tree queries generated by Neumann and Radke [5] to benchmark scalability to large query loads. We rely on the Gurobi MILP solver, which requires user access data to be specified in config.py. The Experiments folder contains all queries and results yielded by our approach, including (1) the raw results produced by the MILP step of our method, (2) subproblems extracted from raw solutions to complete the optimisation of raw MILP results, as well as corresponding subproblem solutions, and finally (3) the complete results combining the raw MILP solutions and subproblem solutions. The Experiments/Thresholds folder includes cost approximation thresholds derived from the preliminary adaptive solution, in accordance to our hybrid method. Finally, the Scripts folder contains utility scripts, such as code to convert problems into the format required by the complementary adaptive method by Neumann and Radke [5], applied by our hybrid algorithm.
